Once again the sun wakes me up. Of course, I struggle to sleep for just a little while longer, but it soon becomes so bright that I can no longer bear it. I try to stand up in my sleeping bag, but my foot gets caught on the way up, so I get a face full of dirt. Today doesn’t look to be much better than yesterday. It’s been a while since I started trying to get out of this forest, but it doesn’t look like I am any closer to the edge than I was the day before. See, I got into this mess when… um… What happened again? Its been so long that I can’t remember. I guess the cause really isn’t all that important. What is important is that I need to get out of this forest, and get a proper meal and sleep in a real bed for once.
            </p>
            <p>
I was pretty lucky to find a small clearing in the forest to camp out in yesterday. Now I can cook myself a nice breakfast. A small luxury, but one that I plan to take advantage of as often as I can. Even oatmeal is a treat out here. But if I want something like that, it is going to take a while. There are plenty of small sticks laying around, so I can use those to make the fire last long enough to at least boil the water. All I need is something to start it with, and luckily, I have a notebook with me. Multiple pages have been torn out in order to start fires, so much so that the content remaining would probably not be understandable. Back before all of this started, I was recording the expedition out.

            <p>
The water I boiled was what I had gathered from a river I passed yesterday. I’m not so lucky as to also have fresh water near where I camped out.
            </p>
            <p>
When it was finally done boiling, I poured some into a bowl with with the oats, and the rest went right into a water container for drinking later today. <i>It really was the right decision to make this.</i> I revel in the warmth of the food. 
            </p>
            <p>
Once it is finally done, I am left with one more choice. Do I continue heading south, or do I try a different direction? If I keep heading south, I am bound to reach something, eventually. With my compass, I won’t even get lost. <i>I guess there really is no choice.</i> And so, after packing up, I continue to follow the compass south.
            </p>
            <p>
A few hours pass. With nothing to keep me interested, I slowly lose track of time. <i>This is no different than if I was driving to work. Except I don’t even get to listen to music.</i> Even while I was thinking this, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a shimmer of a color that didn’t belong. It was a red butterfly. With newfound excitement, I stopped and watched it, until it eventually landed atop my hat. But it didn’t stay for long. In just another moment, it fluttered off into the deeper brush on my right side. <i>I’m not just going to let something this interesting go away. Time to follow it.</i> Unlike the way I was going, the plants were much thicker and harder to pass through.

Pushing through after the butterfly, I eventually see a short waterfall. It feeds into a pool below, and continues into a river that runs just past and just below the place where I am standing. Its so shocking to me, that I lose track of the butterfly I had followed for so long. <i>Its a shame I lost the butterfly, but look at this! This is the perfect place and the perfect time to stop for lunch.</i>
	    </p>

I don’t have much to spare, but I make a simple meal out of crackers and jerky, and then use the cap of my water bottle to make milk with powdered milk. Nowhere near as good as breakfast, but its far better than it could be. Once that is done with, I fill a spare container with as much water as I can get from the river. <i>Now, I have yet another decision to make. Do I go back south? Or do I stay here awhile and relax? Obviously, I stay. What else would I do but swim, given the opportunity?</i>

Eventually, I look up and notice the time. <i>Its already starting to get pretty late. I should probably get going once again.</i> Packing up my things, I pull out my compass and continue to head south.
	    </p>
	    <p>
<i>I’ve never felt more exhausted.</i> The sun is already setting, and I’ve yet to find a good place to stop for the night. Its so late, I pull an energy bar out from my backpack, and eat that just to keep me going. <i>Kinda gross.</i> It does wake me up a little though. I put the wrapper away and take out my flashlight. It is one of the crank types, so I don’t have to worry about batteries while I’m out.

“WHIRRRRRR.” The sound of the flashlight breaks through the mostly silent atmosphere of the night. And when I stop, no sound remains. The sounds I had been hearing up until now instantly stopped after hearing me crank the flashlight. I stop as well.  And in that silence, I stop breathing. Then, sound returns to the area around me, including myself. <i>What are you panicking for?</i> I keep moving, but the flashlight dies instantly. I didn’t crank it long enough. Should I do it again? I muster up the courage and… “WHIRRRRR-” I keep going. “WHIRRRRR-” And more. “WHIRRRRR.” After a full minute, it looks like I have enough charge. <i>There is no chance that things will return to near me.</i> I push through the quiet night.
	    </p>
	    <p>
In an unending hour, I make it to yet another clearing. I don’t have the energy to do anything, apart from throwing down my sleeping bag, and crawling inside. I fall asleep instantly.
